1. I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because unit tests are tests created for more simple instructions and a test for a "message" feature would be too complicated.
2. I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because this is a simple test or instruction that can be simply tested to find out the max length and it wouldn't be too complicated to impleement.
